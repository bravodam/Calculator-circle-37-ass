Reaching this stage hasnt been easy
firstly, Javascript wasnt easy for most of us because we are almost new to coding just one experenced help us
so nwe just had to look for an easier way to go about this project.

 Secondly, getting people out was not easy at all, so we dont have much time to work together,
but thank God we are able to achieve this in a short period of time.
